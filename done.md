2020.02.08 - Perl Dancer runner for GitLab CI
   post fix suggestion to curl 2 perl  DONE

   Running the dancer2 command it is unclear how to get the list of parameters
     -h -? --help just show the short help.
    dancer2 help gen     works, but It was hard to guess.

   Move the token and the URL to external config file:
      Ask: how to add application specific configuration parameters to the config.yml and the environments/* files?
       Maybe add an example to the default config files generated by dancer2 -a

       For now I reused the pluging system and added this:

plugins:
  MyApp:
    default:
      token: 42

   Separate business logic from web app
   Store parameters and show history of processes.
